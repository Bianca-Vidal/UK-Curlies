		<h3>Items To Avoid</h3>
		<img src="img/shampoo.jpg" style="width:90%">
		<p>No to suphate shampoos and tradtionals</p>

		<p> Highstreet shampoos are not good for curly hair because they have one ingredient sulphate which is strips the hair. Due to the fact that curly hair is naturally very dry, sulphate is very damaging to the hair which 
		will lead to breakage.<br>
		<br>
		Another ingredient which is bad for the hair are plastics that are found in conditioners they come in many forms dimithicone,amodimethicone, cyclopentasiloxane, cyclomethicone and dimethiconol. It is most important to have a look at the ending of these ingredients so as a general thumb of rule anything that ends in 'cone, 'xane and 'conol is a plastic. </p>

		<h3>London Testimony of Bianca </h3>
		<img src="img/transition.jpg" style="width: 80%">
		<p>
As a child it was a common sight to have the teeth of an afro-comb to break off in my hair. I have tried everything that I could think of from sprays, oils and lotions. As a teenager I used to get lots of spots on my forehead from the oils used on my hair. As a way to escape from what I thought to be a disaster of my hair, my friend permed my hair straight which did effect the curl pattern of my hair and then I started to use hair straighteners when I started to work in offices for about 5-6 years and used to get a lot of hair cut off from all the damage from the straingteners on a yearly basis.</p>

<p>My hair finally took it's toll in 2015 when I had totally lost the curl pattern from a combination of straightening, perming and bleaching my hair blonde.  In 2015 my hair would be curly at the root and then be dead straight half the way down. It wasn't long after that that I stumbled across a video on youtube about what is widely known as the 'Curly Girl Method' where I found out that she had a book called 'Curly Girl Handbook' which I was able to buy from Amazon. I spent hours researching the best methods and the porosity of my hair. I found out that I had low porosity hair which meant for me it would take an average of 5-6 hours for my hair to dry naturally without any heat tools. I decided to henna my hair black and go back somewhat close to my natural hair colour. It was not long after that I decided to take the big step and go through the big chop at Afrotherapy. I threw out all my shampoo and conditioners as  I found out that there were harmful ingredients to my hair. When I started out I washed my hair with a co-wash and used the Shea moisture Curl Enhancing Souffle and made my own linseed hair gel.</p>
<p>Now I couldn't love my hair more and get complemented on the hair I once hated and thought was a curse. I realise that my hair is what's unique about me and I would not have it any other way.</p>
